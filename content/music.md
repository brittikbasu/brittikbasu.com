**I write songs from my heart**

Music is form of expression. Writing songs has helped me navigate the ups and downs of life.
I wrote my first song when i was 18, after I experienced heartbreak for the first time. It's beautiful how we can extract love and pain and turn them into portals that allow us to navigate back in time and feel what we had experienced before. It also alleviates pain.
