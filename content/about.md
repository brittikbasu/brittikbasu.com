## About Me  
<br />

### ðŸ’¼ Work: Founder of [Filled with Love](https://filledwith.love)

I'm a generalist who can design + code. My clients are impressed with how easily i understand their problems and come up with solutions. I believe UX is a thing because at some point we stopped caring about user's needs. 
Being able to design + code allows me to seamlessly craft solutions that are practical and feasible, it also enables me to collaborate with other designers and developers.

### ðŸŽ¸ Music: I write songs from my heart

Music is form of expression. Writing songs has helped me navigate the ups and downs of life.
I wrote my first song when i was 18, after I experienced heartbreak for the first time. It's beautiful how we can extract love and pain and turn them into portals that allow us to navigate back in time and feel what we had experienced before. It also alleviates pain.

### ðŸŽ™ Podcast: I host the [Learning Curve Podcast](https://learningcurve.dev)

Since i'm always learning, it's important that I share and discuss what's interesting. With every episode I'm becoming a better speaker and it's making me discoverable to other like minded folks.
